### Phase 00: Turborepo, tooling and CLAUDE.md (Oct 3, 2026)

- **Built:** a pnpm and Turborepo workspace:
  - `apps/web`: Next.js 16, placeholder `/`, `GET /api/healthz`.
  - `apps/pipeline`: commander CLI with stub commands, `shard()`, tsup bundle.
  - `packages/core`: env, logger, retry, gcp, versions.
  - `packages/ui` with shadcn set up, and `packages/vitest-config` with the network guard.
  - `services/modeling`: uv, Typer stubs.
  - Dockerfiles for all three services, and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Verified:** `pnpm check` (18 tasks, TypeScript and Python) passes from a fresh copy, along with `pnpm build`, `pnpm dev` and all three Docker images.
- **Differs from the first spec draft:** Next.js 16, TypeScript 7, pnpm 12, Node 24; redaction matches key suffixes. The plan docs were updated to match.
- **Deferred:** CI and the Husky/lint-staged pre-commit hook (plan step 9).
- **Open:** unstage the four `apps/web/src/app` renames my `git mv` staged.
